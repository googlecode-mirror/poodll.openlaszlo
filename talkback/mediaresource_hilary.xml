Nobody believes me when I tell them

Nobody believes me when I tell them

You treat me like a queen when we go out,
wanna show everyone what our love's about.
All wrapped up in me whenever there is a crowd,
But when no ones around...

There's no kindness in your eyes,
The way you look at me, it's just not right.
I can tell whats going on this time,
Theres a stranger in my life.

You're not the person that I once knew.
Are you scared to let them know it's you?
If they could only see you like I do,
Then they would see a stranger too.

that was this cruel to you?
Did I ever make you wonder 
who was standing in the room?

You made yourself look perfect in everyway,
So when this goes down, 
I'm the one that will be blamed.
Your plan is working 
so you can just walk away,
Baby your secret's safe.
